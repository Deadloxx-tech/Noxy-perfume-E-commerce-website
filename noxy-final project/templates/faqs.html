                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">How should I store my perfumes to maintain their quality?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Store perfumes in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity. Ideal temperature is between 59-77°F (15-25°C). Keep bottles upright to prevent evaporation and avoid storing near strong odors that could alter the scent.</p>

                <div class="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">What's the shelf life of perfumes?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Most perfumes last 3-5 years when stored properly. Eau de parfum typically lasts longer than eau de toilette. Signs of deterioration include color changes, separation, or altered scent. Always check the batch code and expiration date on the packaging.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">How can I make my perfume last longer on my skin?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Apply to pulse points (wrists, neck, behind ears), moisturize skin first, and layer with matching body products. Avoid rubbing the fragrance into your skin. Reapply as needed throughout the day for longer-lasting wear.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">Can I mix different perfumes or dilute them?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">While possible, mixing perfumes isn't recommended as it can alter the original composition and reduce quality. Diluting with carrier oils may weaken the scent. For custom blends, consult a professional perfumer rather than experimenting at home.</p>
